# DomainAdaptation

This package is created to tackle the problem of domain shifts when dealing with two domains of different feature distributions. In domain adaptation the training data usually consists of labeled source and unlabeled target domain data. The final goal is to achieve a low generalization error when testing in the target domain.

The package supports pytorch only.
